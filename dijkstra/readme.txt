I have previous C++ experience, so this assignment and the course is a good 
refresher as well as a good way to pick up latest C++ concepts.  In this 
assignment I have used STL extensively.  I have used STL containers vector, 
map, list & STL algorithms related to heap, find, random, chrono, & others. 
Graph is stored using Edge-List, which is better performing in both processing 
& memory for sparse large graphs (20%, 40% edge densities).
      

STL is updated with new features so not only I get to refresh my STL skills but 
to learn some new ways to code with STL.  Some of the new features I have learned 
and used in this assignment includes:  
-convenient use of ‘auto’ instead of long declarations for iterators,  
-lambda expressions as comparison functions within ‘find_if’ function,  
-new ‘random’ with various new random distribution generators,  
-‘chrono’ for time related functions; in this case computing time taken by a process.


Naming conventions used to maximize readability:
-Data types (classes, typedefs) are as  ‘OneTwoThree’
-Local variables are in all small as  ‘onetwothree’
-Member variables are as  ‘m_oneTwoThree’
-Methods & functions are as  ‘oneTwoThree’

The code is edited, compiled & built on Visual Studio Express 2012 

Output.png contains results for three consecutive runs of the executable.

The result for last run is:
-Average Shortest PAth for Edge Density 20% = 6.96865
-Average Shortest PAth for Edge Density 20% = 4.70349
