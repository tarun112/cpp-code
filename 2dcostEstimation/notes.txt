#notes
-source is in c++/ STL
-executable is created using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 RC

-jsoncpp is used to parse JSON file and is used as source contained in folder 'json/' 
-all entities are derived from base class 'Entity'.  And the entity map is as follows:

-Entities
---Vertex
---Edge
-----LineSegment
-----CircularArc

-class 'EntityManager' is a singleton class.  It creates, manages and deletes all entities.
-entities are identified with integer id 'EntityId'.  
-'EntityId' can be used to obtain reference to 'Entity' objects from 'EntityManager'


-To get 'material cost' minimum area bounding box is used(MABB).
-MABB is obtained using 'rotating calipers' method on convex hull.
-for convex hull of a circular arc:
--cut arc does not contributes any points to convex hull.
--extruded arc hull points are approximated using circumscribing polygon points and added to points for convex hull computation


#assumptions
-edges are always from start to end vertex.  This is to get circular arc cut or extrude type.
